The General Aviation accident dataset uses data from six tables defined in the Microsoft Access (MDB) file made available by the [NTSB](https://app.ntsb.gov/avdata/):

* Aircraft
* Events
* Detailed Events data
* Flight Crew
* Flight Time
* Detailed Flight Crew data

The variables available in each table, and the way they relate to one another, is described in this [NTSB document](https://app.ntsb.gov/avdata/eadmspub.pdf). The columns of data made available in the "detailed" tables are listed in full in this [NTSB document](https://app.ntsb.gov/avdata/Mult_Response.pdf).
